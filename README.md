# About Me
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have recently passed the ISTQB foundation certified tester exam and I am complementing this with learning as much about software testing and Quality Assurance as possible in real-world environments (e.g. open-source project work and hands-on learning with friends from the industry) and through tool-specific courses and Codecademy.

I have been developing a good understanding of Agile including the differences between Scrum and Kanban. In the project I am currently working on, I play an active role in sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives.

## Skills

### Manual testing
- Exploratory testing
- Creating a test library (including both happy path and negative testing)
- Test execution and results
- Regression testing

### Automated Testing
- I have been experimenting with running load and stress tests using K6 and viewing the results in Grafana

## Tools

### Postman
I am currently working through the Postman Academy to learn the fundamentals of using Postman to work with APIs
most recently I completed the [API Beginner Learning Path](http://verify.skilljar.com/c/6vc488txhsqg) 

I have been using Postman to test REST API's
-verifying the correctness and functionality of API endpoints
-validating data inputs
-testing security by testing access controls to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive resources
-regression testing after bug fixes

### Jira
- Creation of projects
- Tracking the progress of tickets/stories on the board
- Creating and tracking issues, including bugs (with a bug template) and feature requests (in Cucumber format)
- Assigning epics
- Assessing the backlog and helping to select items for development

### GitKraken
Find my GitKraken [Foundations of Git certificate here](https://learn.gitkraken.com/certificates/rqtjzxwrpp)
- Initialising, cloning, and forking repo's
- Staging and committing changes
- Merging, rebasing & Cherry Picking changes
- Pulling, pushing, and pull requests to and from GitHub repositories

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Creating files
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- Installing dependencies
- Creating jest tests
- Creating K6 load tests
- Running builds
- Running tests
- Debugging
- using copilot to help guide my coding

### Docker
- creating docker containers

### K6 & Grafana
I have been using K6 to carry out load testing, and Grafana to visualise the results

### Playwright
- Creation of manually written tests
- Creation of tests in Visual Studio Code using codegen, turning real-life navigation of a website into usable test code
- Analysing test reports

## DataStores

### PostgreSQL
I have been using PostgreSQL to carry out CRUD on an existing relational database, using SQL to pull and combine data from the different tables

### MongoDB
MongoDB is the document-orientated database that I have been learning to navigate

## My Favourite Chrome Extensions

- Grammarly: For grammar, spell checking and tone checking to ensure content is clear.
- Fake filler: for quick input of randomised dummy data.
- Screen Recorder (scree.io): for quick recordings of test steps to help replicate bugs.
